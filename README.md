# Flutter Test Task

A Flutter test task for DevPace

## UI Requirements

1. Put Logo image on the screen.
2. The screen works with a list of items. This list contains the item’s names.
3. From the beginning the list is empty. There should be two floating action buttons:

- first adds an item to the list;
- second removes the last added item from the list.

4. You should generate tiles with the items names.
5. The tiles list should be aligned to the bottom. You should use the other screen space to center Logo vertically and horizontally.
6. If there are too many items, Logo should be aligned horizontally by it’s minimal margin and a scroll appears.

## BL Requirements

- Use BLoC pattern.
- Implement in any convenient way the data provider, emulate the data loading states.
- Handle possible exceptions (emulate them randomly).
